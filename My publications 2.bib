This paper identifies a cost implementation strategy for 5G by reformulating existing cost models. It analyses three geo-type scenarios and calculates the total cost of ownership (TCO) after estimating the Capex and Opex. The calculations are narrowed to specific cities for clearer understanding instead of the usual generic estimates. An end-to-end 5G network resource analysis is performed. Our result shows that by the end of first year Capex constitutes over 90\% of TCO for urban scenarios. Also uniform capacity deployment across geo-types impose severe investment challenges.},

A unified ANN-based regression model is proposed and implemented to predict Q-factors of all the channels simultaneously. A scenario generator is developed to configure the field-trial testbed with 8 testing channels automatically to generate dynamic scenarios. A network configuration and monitoring database (CMDB) is implemented to collect network configuration and monitoring data that include link information, operational parameters of key optical devices, network configuration state, and real-time Q-factors of the available channels for the generated network scenarios. These collected data are used for training and testing of the developed ANN model. In order to achieve multiple channel predictions, we propose a hot coding method to represent the state of dynamic channel. Besides, an auto-search method is used to search the best hyperparameters of the ANN-based model. The results show that the proposed ANN-based regression model converges quickly, and it can predict the multi-channel’s Q-factors with high accuracy. The unified ANN-based multi-channel Qfactor regression model can provide the comprehensive information to assist SDN controller to optimize network configuration for dynamic optical networks.},

When directly-modulated distribution feedback (DFB) lasers are used as transmitter source, the BMR needs to take additional measures to compensate the effects of the laser frequency chirp. In this paper, we design a coherent optical BMR for a directly-modulated DFB laser source with On-Off Keying (OOK) modulation.

  abstract = {Virtual data center (VDC) solutions provide an environment that is able to quickly scale up, and where virtual machines and network resources can be quickly added on-demand through self-service procedures. VDC providers must support multiple simultaneous tenants with isolated networks on the same physical substrate. The provider must make efficient use of its available physical resources while providing high-bandwidth and low-latency connections to tenants with a variety of VDC configurations. This paper utilizes state-of-the-art optical network elements to provide high-bandwidth optical interconnections and develop a VDC architecture to slice the network and the compute resources dynamically, to efficiently divide the physical network between tenants. We present a data center virtualization architecture with a software-defined networking controlled all-optical data plane combining optical circuit switching and a time-shared optical network. Developed network orchestration dynamically translates and provisions VDCs requests onto the optical physical layer. The experimental results show the provisioned bandwidth can be varied by adjusting the number of time slots allocated in the time-division multiplexing (TDM) network. These results lead to recommendations for provisioning TDM connections with different performance characteristics. Moreover, application-level optical switch reconfiguration time is also evaluated to fully understand the impact on application performance in VDC provision. The experimental demonstration confirmed that the developed VDC approach introduces negligible delay and complexity on the network side.},

Specifically, the ability to make a number of previously fixed transmission parameters tunable, for example the data rate or channel spacing, requires an evolution of the node architecture.

In this paper, we report the work carried out in the ICT IDEALIST project and in particular the data plane solutions towards 1Tb/s optical networks with flexgrid and flex-rate technology. Flexibility requires changes in optical cross-connect, transponder as well as in the digital layer.

The novel scheme exploits nonlinear effects and gain saturation phenomenon in the semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). This technique uses gain-compression dynamics between the input pulses and the generated ones in gain-saturated SOA to form square pulses. The center wavelength of the generated optical square pulse can be tuned from 1530 to 1570 nm by adjusting the center wavelength of the optical band pass filter (OBPF) in the SOA-based mode-locked fiber ring laser. The duty cycle of the output pulse can be tuned from 12.7 to 88.4\%, which strongly depends on the input power and intra-cavity power.},

For this purpose, software defined networking (SDN) is proposed, as the control paradigm will integrate all network segments and heterogeneous optical and wireless network technologies together with massive storage and computing infrastructures. The control orchestration protocol is presented as a unified transport application programming interface solution for joint cloud/network orchestration, allowing interworking of heterogeneous control planes to provide provisioning and recovery of quality of service (QoS)-aware end-to-end services. End-to-end QoS is guaranteed by provisioning and restoration schemes, which are proposed for optical circuit/packet switching restoration by means of signal monitoring and adaptive modulation and adaptive route control, respectively. The proposed solution is experimentally demonstrated in an international multi-partner test bed, which consists of a multi-domain transport network comprising optical circuit switching and optical packet switching domains controlled by SDN/OpenFlow and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control planes and a distributed cloud infrastructure. The results show the dynamic provisioning of IT and network resources and recovery capabilities of the architecture.},

  abstract = {In current dynamic optical networks with cascaded filters and amplifiers, the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) can vary significantly from channel to channel. Under such uncertainty, OSNR prediction for unestab-lished channels becomes indispensable but remains a big challenge. For protective network planning purposes such as margin threshold setting or wavelength assignment, it is desirable to evaluate the worst OSNR performance of each network link. Such exploration will unavoidably employ active monitoring probes, which may cause interruptions to the network. An efficient active monitoring strategy that optimizes the choice of probes or monitoring trials is needed. We propose a "self-learning" monitoring strategy integrated at intermediate nodes. Our method can intelligently select the channel to be monitored in order to search for the target global maxima of OSNR degradation for a specific link. Our monitoring scheme detects intermediate node OSNR in the linear regime. It is shown that our method can predict the target OSNR value with only 0.5 dB error while reducing the required monitoring data by up to 91\% compared to conventional methods.},

Virtualizeable bandwidth variable transceiver (V-BVT) is a key enabler in supporting the creation of multiple VONs. In this paper, we present a feasible V-BVT architecture that can be a part of a software-defined optical network. The proposed V-BVT has a novelty to offer independent operation, control, and management abilities to the clients or higher level network controllers. In addition, a specific V-BVT virtualization algorithm is proposed, in order to enable the efficient creation of multiple coexisting, but independent virtual transceivers that share the same V-BVT physical resources. The virtual transceiver can provide specific bit rate, subcarrier, modulation format, and a corresponding baud rate to each VON, based on the requirement of the VON demand, V-BVT resources availability, and optical network status. We further realize the proposed V-VBT architecture on an experimental platform with a software-defined network controller. The V-BVT resource allocation through the proposed virtualization algorithm is also performed using the extended OpenFlow protocol. The proposed and experimentally demonstrated V-BVT achieves independence in virtual transceivers control and management in the control plane, while maintaining the coexisting and isolation features in the physical layer.},

Such design integrates optical circuit switching (OCS) and optical packet switching (OPS) schemes via hybrid Top-of-the-Rack (ToR) switches which provide flexible function-switchover between different traffic patterns in the DCN. Simulations of network behaviors under such DC traffic loads indicate that the proposed OPS/OCS DCN can effectively improve the network performance. Moreover, via a preliminary analysis of OCS and OPS network configurations, the construction of hybrid DCN is also proved as the most cost- and energy-efficient way for DCN upgrading while offering a promised quality of service. An experimental demonstration shows a complete implementation of data center virtualization in the proposed hybrid data center network.},

Placing the SIC in each server/blade, we eliminate electronics from the top of rack (ToR) switch by pushing all the functionality on each blade while enabling direct intrarack blade-to-blade communication to deliver ultralow chip-to-chip latency. We demonstrate the disaggregated DCN architecture scenarios along with all-optical dimension-programmable N × M spectrum selective Switches (SSS) and an architecture-on-demand (AoD) optical backplane. OPS and OCS complement each other as do TDM and WDM, which can support variable traffic flows. A flat disaggregated DCN architecture is realized by connecting the optical ToR switches directly to either an optical top of cluster switch or the intracluster AoD optical backplane, while clusters are further interconnected to an intercluster AoD for scaling out.},

A multielement fiber is used for SDM transmission to provide a large quantity of optical links between the top-of-racks (ToRs) and the function programmable cluster switch. Beam-steering large-port-count fiber switches, used as central cluster switches and intercluster switch, provide a single hop optical circuit switching solution, and also enable network function programmability for DCN to support variable traffic patterns and different network functions. A TDM switch as a plug-in function provides intra-cluster communication with variable capacity and low latency. The flat-structured intra data center architecture, with a circuit-switched SDM and TDM hybrid network enables scalable, large-capacity and low-latency DCN communication. In addition, all-optical ToR-to-ToR inter-DCN is realized through metro/core networks. A highly-nonlinear fiber based all-optical SDM-to-WDM converter transfers three SDM signals to three-carrier spectral superchannel signals, which are transmitted to the destination DCN, through the metro/core networks. The all-optical ToR-ToR cross-DCN connections enable the geographically distributed DCNs to appear as one big data center.},

  abstract = {Optical Ethernet gains great success in varied optical domains. Ethernet while providing the elastic allocation of bandwidth per flow is currently restricted to being transported over fixed-rate fixed-grid optical channels. However, as data transmission and switching in optical networks is becoming more flexible, the current Ethernet to optical interface with fixed functions and fixed design face great challenges for applications in an elastic optical network. In addition, the coexisted Ethernet standards in optical networks also need a converter to transform low-capacity Ethernet signals to high-capacity Ethernet signals. In this paper, we propose a real-time Ethernet to software-defined programmable sliceable transponder based on network function programmable Ethernet to elastic optical networks (ETH-EON) interface, multiformat supported transmitter and architecture-on-demand (AoD)-based superchannel signal processor. The transponder parses the Ethernet traffic and then transports it over a number of optical carriers with the appropriate baud-rate, modulation format and associated spectral bandwidth. Software-defined reconfigurability of both electronic (i.e., FPGA) and optics (AoD) allow for a flexible transponder to offer high Ethernet to optical transport efficiency. Ethernet capacities from 40 Gbit/s to 2.88 Tbit/s can be provided by reconfiguring the modulation formats and the used optical carrier number. The modulation format adaptability also provides a tradeoff between transmission capacity and transmission distance, to optimize network performance. The designed software-defined sliceable elastic transponder aggregate multiple Ethernet traffic flows and send spectral-efficient signals through the elastic optical network with simple Ethernet protocols, avoiding using complex and expensive OTN technologies. Finally, we demonstrate the converter in elastic optical networks for several application scenarios.},

  abstract = {An actively mode-locked fiber ring laser based on cross-gain modulation (XGM) in a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) is demonstrated to operate stably with a simple configuration. By forward injecting an easily-generated external pulse train, the mode-locked fiber laser can generate an optical-pulse sequence with pulsewidth about 6 ps and average output power about 7.9 mW. The output pulses show an ultra-low RMS jitter about 70.7 fs measured by a RF spectrum analyzer. The use of the proposed forward-injection configuration can realize the repetition-rate tunability from 1 to 15 GHz for the generated optical-pulse sequences. By employing a wavelength-tunable optical band-pass filter in the laser cavity, the operation wavelength of the designed SOA-based actively mode-locked fiber laser can be tuned continuously in a wide span between 1528 and 1565 nm. The parameters of external-injection optical pulses are studied experimentally to optimize the mode-locked fiber laser.},

  abstract = {This letter presents the effective design of a tunable 80 Gbit/s wavelength converter with a simple configuration consisting of a single semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) and an optical bandpass filter (OBPF). Based on both cross-gain and cross-phase modulation in SOA, the polarity-preserved, ultrafast wavelength conversion is achieved by appropriately filtering the blue-chirped spectral component of a probe light. Moreover, the experiments are carried out to investigate into the wavelength tunability and the maximum tuning range of the designed wavelength converter. Our results show that a wide wavelength conversion range of nearly 35 nm is achieved with 21-nm downconversion and 14-nm upconversion, which is substantially limited by the operation wavelength ranges of a tunable OBPF and a tunable continuous-wave laser in our experiment. We also exploited the dynamics characteristics of the wavelength converter with variable input powers and different injection current of SOA. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
