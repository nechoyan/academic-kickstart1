title: "Programmable ROADM systems for multi-core fibre based SDM networks"
event: International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON 2020)
event_url: https://icton2020.fbk.eu/
location: Bari, Italy 
summary:  Invited talk about Programmable SDM/WDM ROADM
abstract: This talk discussed the design of programmable ROADM for Multi-core fibre based SDM networks. Fibre-core bypassing, which was introduced in our previous paper ["Hardware-EfÔ¨Åcient ROADM Design with Fiber-Core Bypassing for WDM/SDM Networks"](http://yanshuangyi.com/publication/lida-liu-hardware-efcient-2020/) requires dynamic reconfigurations to improve network performance. The talk summarise our recent research on this topic. Here is the link for the [youtube recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRZNFYjPf7Y)
