 abstract = {The present invention provides a 64QAM signal generation method and system. The method comprises: a double-drive IQ modulator receiving input optical signals, dividing the input optical signals into a first input optical signal and a second input optical signal, inputting the first input optical signal into a first sub-modulator on an I-arm, and inputting the second input optical signal into a second sub-modulator on a Q-arm; the first sub-modulator receiving a first two-level drive signal and a first four-level drive signal, and based on the two signals, modulating the first input optical signal into a first 8-order amplitude phase modulating signal and outputting the first 8-order amplitude phase modulating signal; the second sub-modulator receiving a second two-level drive signal and a second four-level drive signal, and based on the two signals, modulating the second input optical signal into a second 8-order amplitude phase modulating signal and outputting the second 8-order amplitude phase modulating signal; and combining the first 8-order amplitude phase modulating signal and the second Q-arm 8-order amplitude phase modulating signal to generate a 64QAM signal. The implementing solution of the present invention is simple and has a low cost.},
