 abstract = {A scheme for the conversion of spatially-multiplexed channels to a wavelength superchannel is presented and characterized. The viability of deployment of this scheme at network nodes located at the boundaries between spatialdivision- multiplexed (SDM) and standard single mode fiber (SSMF) wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) networks is demonstrated.},
