 abstract = {5G, IoT and other emerging network applications drive the future optical network to be more flexible and dynamic. Fully awareness of current network status is critical for better network programming in short timescale. In this paper, the centralized network database with network monitoring data and network configuration information enables network analytics application to support the future dynamic and programmable optical network.},
