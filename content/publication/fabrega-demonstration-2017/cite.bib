 abstract = {In this Paper, we experimentally demonstrate highly flexible and intelligent interdomain coordinated actions based on adaptive software-defined networking (SDN) orchestration. An advanced multidomain multitechnology testbed is implemented, which consists of a 400-Gb/s variable capacity optical packet switching domain and a Tb/s-class flexi-grid wavelength division multiplexed optical circuit switching domain. The SDN-controllable transponders and the extended transport applications programming interface enable the congestion-aware provisioning of end-to-end real-time services. At the data plane level, different transponders based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing are employed for inter/intradomain links in order to adaptively provision services with fine granularity. For adaptation, SDN-capable domain-specific optical performance monitors are also introduced. In the control plane, the applications based network operations architecture has been extended and addressed as an adaptive SDN orchestrator.},
