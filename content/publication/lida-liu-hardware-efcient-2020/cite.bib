 abstract = {A SDM/WDM ROADM is proposed with low port-count WSSs. Fiber-core bypassing reduces the number of and port-count of WSSs in the implementation. The design requires less hardware without compromising on network performance with the developed routing core and wavelength assignment algorithm.},
