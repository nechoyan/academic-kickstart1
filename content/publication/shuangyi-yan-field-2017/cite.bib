 abstract = {An SDN based network planning framework utilizing machine-learning techniques, network configuration and monitoring database is implemented over an optical field-trial testbed comprised of 436.4-km fibre. Adaption of the spectral efficiency utilising probabilistic-shaping BVT based on link performance prediction is demonstrated.},
