 abstract = {A multi-domain optical infrastructure with end-to-end Ethernet transport capability can deliver Ethernet services over a large scale and provide a promising solution for inter data center networks (DCN) communication. The already existed metro and core networks should be evolved both in data plane and control plane towards to support the heterogeneous and dynamic Ethernet traffic environment. In this paper, we report the work carried out in the ICT STRAUSS project to provide Ethernet connections for intra-DCN and inter-DCN over metro and core networks. The key technologies for intra- and inter- DCN communications are reported with experimental validation.},
