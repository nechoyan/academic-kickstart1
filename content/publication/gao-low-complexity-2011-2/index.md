abstract: "A low-complexity feed-forward carrier phase estimation (CPE) technique is presented for dual-polarization (DP)-16-QAM transmission systems. By combining QPSK partitioning, maximum likelihood (ML) detection and phase offset estimation between signals in different polarizations, simulation and experimental results for a 200Gb/s DP-16-QAM system demonstrate similar linewidth tolerance to the best feed-forward CPE reported to date while the computational complexity is at least three times lower compared with other simplified feed-forward CPE techniques."
