 abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate multiple advanced functionalities of a cost-effective high-capacity sliceable-BVT using multicarrier technology. It is programmable, adaptive and reconfigurable by an SDN controller for efficient resource usage, enabling unique granularity, flexibility and grid adaptation, even in conventional fixed-grid networks.},
