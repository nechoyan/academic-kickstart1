abstract: "A multi-domain and multi-technology optical network orchestration is demonstrated in an international testbed located in Japan, the UK and Spain. The Application-Based Network Operations (ABNO) architecture is proposed as a carrier Software-Defined Network (SDN) solution for provisioning end-to-end optical transport services through a multi-domain multi-technology network scenario, consisting of a 46-108 Gb/s variable-capacity OpenFlow-capable optical packet switching network and a programmable, flexi-grid elastic optical path network."
