abstract: "A feasible optical virtualize-able transceiver is proposed to support virtual optical networks by creating multiple co-existing virtual transceivers controlled by SDN. This solution is experimentally demonstrated, showing on-demand selection of subcarriers, channel spacing and modulation formats."
