abstract: "5G network demands massive infrastructure deployment to meet its requirements. The most cost-effective deployment solution is now a challenge. This paper identifies a cost implementation strategy for 5G by reformulating existing cost models. It analyses three geo-type scenarios and calculates the total cost of ownership (TCO) after estimating the Capex and Opex. The calculations are narrowed to specific cities for clearer understanding instead of the usual generic estimates. An end-to-end 5G network resource analysis is performed. Our result shows that by the end of first year Capex constitutes over 90% of TCO for urban scenarios. Also uniform capacity deployment across geo-types impose severe investment challenges."
