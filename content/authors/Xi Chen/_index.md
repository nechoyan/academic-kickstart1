Xi Chen is a Ph. D student at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China. From Jan. 2019 to Dec. 2019, he worked at University of Bristol as a visiting student from Jan 2019 to Jan 2020. His research mainly focuses on the adaptive modulation and coding for short-reach multicarrier systems, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and filter bank multicarrier (FBMC). Based on various flexible modulation and coding techniques including probabilistic shaping, time-domain hybrid QAM, FEC and precoding, he proposed several adaptive loading algorithms to enhance the capacity and flexibility of the transmission link, supporting the development of elastic optical networks.
