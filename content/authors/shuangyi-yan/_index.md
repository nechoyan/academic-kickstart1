Dr Shuangyi Yan is a lecturer in the High Performance Networks group, Smart Internet Lab at the University of Bristol. He received the B.E degree in information engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China in 2004. In 2009, he got the PhD degree in optical engineering from Xi’an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, CAS, Xi’an, China. From 2011 to 2013, he worked in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, as a postdoctoral researcher on the spectra-efficient long-haul optical transmission system and low-cost short-range transmission system. In July 2013, he joined the High Performance Networks Group at University of Bristol. His research focuses on machine-learning applications in dynamic optical networks and 5G Beyond networks, programmable optical networks, and data centre networks. He is the author or co-author of over 80 refereed publications, of which consist several post-deadline papers in optical communication related top-level conferences. He also served as Technical Program Committee members and Co-Chairs in several conferences, such as EuCNC, ONDM, OECC, and ACP.
