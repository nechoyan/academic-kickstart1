5G-CLARITY will develop and demonstrate a beyond 5G system for private networks integrating 5G, Wi-Fi, and LiFi technologies, and managed through AI based autonomic networking.
5G-CLARITY aims to be instrumental in order to secure the leadership of Europe in the growing markets of private 5G networks, and 5G for factory automation.
5G-CLARITY brings forward the design of a system for beyond 5G private networks that addresses the challenges in spectrum flexibility, delivery of critical services, and autonomic network management.
The first pillar of our vision is a heterogeneous wireless access network that integrates three technologies: 5G beyond R16, Wi-Fi, and LiFi.
The second pillar of our vision is a novel management plane based on the principles of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, in order to enable network slicing for neutral hosts, and autonomic network management.
